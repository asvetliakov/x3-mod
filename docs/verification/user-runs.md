# Outstanding user gameplay runs

Updated 2026-09-15. Run 17 crypto acceptance and the first-person/chase
left-centre-right diagnostic are complete and are not in this queue. The agent
never launches the game. The installed build is described in [status](../status.md).
From the repository root, paste a `./x3run` command below. The executable
[launcher script](../../x3run) handles the shared lock and log snapshots; no shell
function setup is needed. Runs 1–3 and 5–20 are complete (queue numbers; reader/DAT/adjacency fast
co-activation passed as snapshot run 19). Run 9 is saved as snapshot run 28.
Close X3 between runs and report completed numbers. After exit, the helper prints
a fresh `/tmp/x3-bottleX3-run<N>/` path containing that session’s log and referenced
captures, so later A/B runs cannot overwrite them. Vanilla/dry-run creates no snapshot.
Since 2026-09-14 the linear distance-fade route is on by default whenever
`--linear-materials --taa` are present ([region note](../architecture/linear-distance-fade-region.md),
"Default"); the queue commands below keep `--linear-distance-fade` spelled out,
which is the same resolved setting, and `--no-linear-distance-fade` opts out.

| Run | Purpose | Sessions | Status |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| 1 | Chase aiming/framing + reader/adjacency verification | 0 | Accepted as run 18 |
| 2 | Sharpen/shimmer + camera cuts with TAA | 0 | Merged into run 6 |
| 3 | Automatic exposure + bloom off/on | 0 | Completed: A run 24; B run 25 exposed bloom initialization failure |
| 4 | Vanilla double-cursor/menu-bar comparison | 0 | Completed 2026-09-14 (vanilla, no snapshot): the double cursor reproduces in vanilla after alt-tab when the desktop cursor is moved outside the window before returning; vanilla behaviour, not a proxy regression |
| 5 | Reader/adjacency fast modes | 0 | Accepted as run 19 |
| 6 | Linear hull materials off/on plus sharpen/cuts at fixed exposure | 0 | Completed: A run 20, B runs 21–23; analysis/quality follow-ups remain |
| 7 | Fixed/automatic exposure and bloom toggles, central chase HUD and selection timing | 0 | Completed as run 26; follow-ups combined into run 8 |
| 8 | Restored glow, milder exposure and native selection-stutter trace | 0 | Completed as run 27 |
| 9 | Stronger glow and selection/voice timing | 0 | Completed as run 28 on source `d9413fc` |
| 10 | Target-name speech with the opt-in WMA decoder | 0 | Superseded: load hang fixed by the DMO fallback hook; speech accepted as run 18 |
| 11 | Fade region route and alpha-tested cutout, combined | 1 | Completed as user run 11, snapshot run36 |
| 12 | Voice load-hang Wine trace witness (no new build) | 0 | Completed as user run 12, snapshot run37 (trace `/tmp/x3-witness-quartz.log.z`, 5.0 GB) |
| 13 | Target-name speech with the decoder plugin and the DMO fallback hook | 0 | Attempted as run 38 (execute-access fault, fixed); retried and completed as run 16 |
| 14 | Station source-over linear route, fade region and shimmer trace, combined | 0 | Completed as user run 14, snapshot run39 (witness clean, port composed, darkening persists) |
| 16 | Run 13 retry: target-name speech with the decoder plugin and the fixed DMO fallback hook | 0 | Completed as user run 16, snapshot run41: loads, speech works, crackle under investigation |
| 17 | Bullet bound after near-plane clipping, packed_sample brightness | 0 | Completed as user run 17, snapshot run42: 100 % bound, witness clean, dimmer unresolved (centre sample) |
| 18 | Voice crackle fix: decoder plugin v4 (no new DLL) | 0 | Completed as user run 18, snapshot run46: no crackle, voice fine |
| 19 | Combined: AO off/on (Ctrl+Shift+F11), bullets at gain 1, cutout shimmer fix, same-port far/near pair | 0 | Completed as user run 19, snapshot run47: cutout exemption holds (`reason=3` 0.01 %), bolts accepted at gain 1; AO runs but is invisible at 2 m, port darkening and asteroid triangle dropout still open |
| 15 | Screen emission on bullets (packed policy 8 in the region bracket) | 0 | Completed as user run 15, snapshot run40: witness clean, 50 % of bullet draws refused (w ≤ 0), near-fullscreen brackets; bound fix in progress |
| 20 | Asteroid prepass jitter, port and ship far/near pairs, step D bullets, AO radius 20, loading markers | 0 | Completed as user run 20, snapshot run48: asteroid triangle dropout fixed and accepted, step-D brackets no longer fullscreen, loading markers fired; AO ran in debug view only, port darkening still open |
| 21 | AO appearance at a readable footprint (`--ao-radius 100`, no debug view), bullet witness every frame, vanilla port approach | 1 | Completed as user run 21, snapshot run49 (session A only): the fade witness is clean on the firing frames and the bolts are accepted, AO is invisible at radius 100 and is now default-off, a new station-section jitter at ~4.7 km is under diagnosis; session B (vanilla port approach) has not been reported |

Completed run commands and instructions are preserved in
[the completed-run archive](../archive/user-runs-completed.md); they are provenance,
not rerun requests.

| 22 | LOD scale 2×, fade-band trembling fix, docking-port screenshot pair | 0 | Completed as user run 22, snapshot run51: trembling gone, LOD 2× applied, module darkening owned by point-light range |
| 23 | LOD scale 3× on the run-49 route, frame cost | 1 | Ready (no new DLL; installed `53a0d8a7…`) |

## 23. LOD scale 3× on a known route, frame cost — Ready

No new build. Same command as run 22 with `--lod-scale 3`. Fly the same sector and route as
run 21 session A (the station approach and the asteroid field) so the LOD distribution and the
frame time compare against run 49; say whether detail holds farther than at 2× and whether the
frame rate drops in the busiest view. Press F8 once at the station approach and once in the
asteroid field. Analysis: `lod_scale_value … applied=3`, `object_context lod=` shares vs runs 49/51,
`frame_end dt_ms` vs run 49 on the same route, draws per frame.

```sh
./x3run --direct --camera chase --ownership --object-trace --object-lifetime \
  --motion-output --taa --telemetry --camera-log 1 \
  --hdr --hdr-tonemap --hdr-exposure fixed --hdr-bloom --linear-materials \
  --crypt-cache --gz-buffer --resource-read fast --dat-handles --mesh-adjacency fast \
  --fade-witness 1 --screen-emission \
  --lod-scale 3 \
  --voice-decoder /tmp/x3-wma-plugin-v4 \
  --capture-start 999999 --capture-frames 8
```
